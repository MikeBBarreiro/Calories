#Calories
========
This is a (not finnished) Calories-Calculator! This project will do the Following:

- ask for your weight
- Then ask for your gender
- after that, what did you eat?
- then how many calories was the item you have eaten

========
After it askes your gender, the prompts will then run in a **WHILE LOOP**, thus making the questions repeat untill you enter (q)uit.
Once the loop is done it then runs through the arrays used to add the callaries together if entered more then once. 
Then goes to an If/Else statement, If M for male, the number of calories inputed will then divide by 4000 if greater then or equal to and should leave a result! else F for female should do the same, but with 3000 instead.

##This Project is not as acurate as should be!
This project is still not done and i need to tweak a few things!

_But thank you for reading!_ :D
